## Start the app

To start the front-end app, run `npx nx serve angular16-auth`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!

To start the back-end api, run `npx  nx serve csharp-api`

## Notes

### CsharpAPI.csproj

- ImplicitUsing: This feature is enabled which tells the compiler to auto generate a set of global using directives bases on the project type, removing the need to include a lot of common usingstatements in each class file.

### build

under the folder in which .csproj file is located, run

> dontnet build
